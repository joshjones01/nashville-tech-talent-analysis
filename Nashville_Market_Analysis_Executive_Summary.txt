  4. SKILL RARITY INDEX
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  (1 = very common  →  10 = extremely rare)

  [██████████] 10/10  Model Context Protocol (MCP)
           ULTRA-RARE  |  Dice: ~5-10 explicit listings nationally
           Anthropic's MCP is brand-new (2025-2026). Very few certified practitioners exist. Joshua holds the Anthropic Advanced MCP certification.

  [████████░░] 8/10  AI/ML + Data Analytics (combined)
           HIGH-DEMAND / RARE at entry level  |  Dice: ~1,062 listings nationally
           Strong demand but most postings require 5+ years. Hands-on predictive modeling experience with Cursor AI at an early career stage is uncommon.

  [████████░░] 8/10  CompTIA Quad-Stack (A+, Data+, Cloud+, Network+)
           RARE combination  |  Dice: N/A (certification, not search keyword)
           Breadth across IT fundamentals, data management, cloud architecture, and networking. Very few data analysts also hold Cloud+ and Network+.

  [███████░░░] 7/10  Power BI / Data Visualization
           HIGH-DEMAND / LOW-SUPPLY in Nashville  |  Dice: ~29 listings (Nashville + remote)
           Only 1 Power BI-specific role in Nashville. National demand is strong but local supply of practitioners is thin.

  [███████░░░] 7/10  Revenue Forecasting & Profitability Modeling
           NICHE  |  Dice: 0 exact Nashville matches
           Hands-on revenue forecasting for multi-unit retail is a specialized skill rarely found in early-career candidates.

  [██████░░░░] 6/10  Python (Data/Analytics focus)
           IN-DEMAND  |  Dice: ~83 listings (Nashville + remote)
           Python is the #1 language for data analytics. Strong demand, moderate supply.

  [██████░░░░] 6/10  API Integration (Square, webhooks, custom)
           MODERATE-HIGH when combined with analytics  |  Dice: Embedded in many roles but rarely standalone
           API-first data extraction is in growing demand. Combining API skills with analytics is a strong differentiator.

  [█████░░░░░] 5/10  JavaScript / Node.js (for data dashboarding)
           MODERATE  |  Dice: ~105 listings (Nashville + remote)
           Many JS developers exist, but few combine JS with data analytics and dashboard automation.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  5. COST-BENEFIT OVERVIEW
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  At $60,000/year, Joshua's asking salary positions well below market:

    • 55.5% below the national median for comparable roles
    • 54.7% below the Nashville average for comparable roles
    • Represents ~$74,700/yr in savings vs. national median
    • Represents ~$72,454/yr in savings vs. Nashville average

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────┐
    │  Skill Area                              │  Typical Range    │

    │  Data Analyst (Python, SQL, Excel)       │  $56K – $160K     │
    │  Power BI / Dashboard Developer          │  $62K – $166K     │
    │  Node.js Automation Developer            │  $100K – $150K    │
    │  AI/ML Practitioner                      │  $80K – $257K     │
    │  Data Scientist                          │  $97K – $237K     │
    │  Data Engineer                           │  $48K – $223K     │
    │  MCP-Certified (Anthropic Advanced)      │  Emerging / rare  │
    │  CompTIA Quad-Certified                  │  $62K – $135K     │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────┘

  Joshua's profile combines data analytics, AI/ML proficiency, full-stack
  JavaScript, MCP certification, and four CompTIA certifications — a breadth
  of capability that typically commands significantly higher compensation.

  The MCP certification is particularly noteworthy: as of February 2026,
  fewer than a handful of Dice listings explicitly mention Model Context
  Protocol by name, yet enterprise adoption of agentic AI frameworks is
  accelerating. An Anthropic Advanced MCP-certified practitioner who also
  builds dashboards, writes Python, and models revenue is an uncommon find.
