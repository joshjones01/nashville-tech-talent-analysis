  2. SKILL RARITY & MARKET VALUE
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Joshua's certifications and hands-on experience place him in a
  remarkably thin talent pool. The index below reflects how scarce
  each skill is among current Dice.com candidates and job postings.

  (1 = common → 10 = extremely rare)

  [██████████] 10/10  Model Context Protocol (MCP)
                 Anthropic's MCP is brand-new (2025-2026). Very few certified
                 practitioners exist. Joshua holds the Anthropic Advanced MCP certification.

  [████████░░]  8/10  AI/ML + Data Analytics (combined)
                 Strong demand but most postings require 5+ years. Hands-on predictive
                 modeling experience with Cursor AI at an early career stage is uncommon.

  [████████░░]  8/10  CompTIA Quad-Stack (A+, Data+, Cloud+, Network+)
                 Breadth across IT fundamentals, data management, cloud architecture,
                 and networking. Very few data analysts also hold Cloud+ and Network+.

  [███████░░░]  7/10  Power BI / Data Visualization
                 Only 1 Power BI-specific role in Nashville. National demand is strong
                 but local supply of practitioners is thin.

  [███████░░░]  7/10  Revenue Forecasting & Profitability Modeling
                 Hands-on revenue forecasting for multi-unit retail is a specialized
                 skill rarely found in early-career candidates.

  [██████░░░░]  6/10  Python (Data/Analytics focus)
                 Python is the #1 language for data analytics. Strong demand, moderate supply.

  [██████░░░░]  6/10  API Integration (Square, webhooks, custom)
                 API-first data extraction is in growing demand. Combining API skills
                 with analytics is a strong differentiator.

  [█████░░░░░]  5/10  JavaScript / Node.js (for data dashboarding)
                 Many JS developers exist, but few combine JS with data analytics
                 and dashboard automation.

  The combination is what matters most. Thousands of professionals
  possess one or two of these skills; almost none hold all of them.
  The Anthropic Advanced MCP credential alone narrows the field to
  a handful of practitioners nationally — and Joshua pairs it with
  four CompTIA certifications, production AI/ML work, and full-stack
  development experience.

  3. WHAT THIS SKILLSET COMMANDS
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Based on 115 national and 13 Nashville salary data points:

    National median range:  $114,400 – $155,000/yr
    Nashville avg range:    $119,417 – $145,491/yr
    National median midpt:  $134,700/yr
    Nashville avg midpt:    $132,454/yr
    Joshua's ask:           $60,000/yr

    → 55.5% below national median  (~$74,700/yr difference)
    → 54.7% below Nashville avg   (~$72,454/yr difference)

  Individually, each skill area Joshua covers commands:

    Data Analyst                   $56K – $213K
    Python Developer               $83K – $286K
    AI / ML Engineer               $80K – $257K
    BI Analyst / Power BI          $62K – $184K
    MCP / AI Automation            Emerging — very few benchmarks exist
    Node.js / JavaScript           $101K – $380K
    Data Scientist                 $97K – $237K
    Data Engineer                  $48K – $223K

  A candidate who spans multiple rows of this table — particularly
  MCP, AI/ML, and analytics together — represents a rare convergence
  of capability that the market has not yet fully priced.
